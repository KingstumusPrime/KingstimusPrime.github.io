                    <p>A custom POSIX compatible 32 bit operating and C Library written from complete scratch. Written primarily in C but leverages assembly to complete low level tasks and boot the operating system. Contains a monolithic kernel design and supports the FAT filesystem, ATA drives, basic I/O, user mode, virtual memory, VESA video modes, and Linux-style file handling. Along with this it has a relatively mature LibC and operating systems specific toolchain capable of porting basic programs such as the famous Doom I & II.</p>

                    <p>Crown.JS is a Javascript library that attempts to streamline the creation of canvas based games in Javascript. It leverages Inherence and a classical object-oriented structure to allow the user to expand upon the engine and add features needed only for that project. Features include sprites, actors, a custom input system, a smooth movement library, and dynamic camera that supports shake. In addition the project also contains a bonus multiplayer header that serves as a wrapper for <a href="https://peerjs.com/">PEER.JS</a>. Allowing for multiplayer functionality in minutes.</p>

                <p>My name is Kingston James and I have been programming as a hobby for around 5 years. I first started by learning Scratch then quickly moved onto Unreal Engine (blueprints) then C++. Ever since then I have followed a project based learning approach and am constantly trying to build new things. I'm an active student at St Petersburg Collage with a 4.0 GPA and I love participating in different activities held on campus. You will currently find me looking for a way to hone my skills by working with real-world professionals through internships.</p>

I was past wanting to know how things work; I wanted to make it work all by myself. This project ended up being is a hodgepodge of languages, including Python, C++, JavaScript, and Java. It contains a parser (JavaScript), a lexer (Python), and two VMs (C++ and Java). While I had some vision of tying it all together, I never completed the whole language toolchain.</p>

                    <p>While I got a bit of fame from the multiplayer game, I was a bit tired of writing JavaScript. Instead I wanted to expand on the skills I was starting to finally understand from G--. So after a bit of research, I came across NAND2Tetris on Coursera. I already knew a bit of Logism and did not want to learn the VHDL used in the course. So I set out on a journey to port the course to Logism blueprints. In addition to the CPU, there was also a Python assembler for the HACK assembly specification proposed in the course. All in all, this project taught me a bit about CPU design and a ton about logic gates.</p>

                    <p>After making the multiplayer game, I had wanted to replicate something like that forever. Inspired by .io games, I wanted to make a combat-based platformer. After making a ton of failed prototypes, this idea held a huge status for me, with me mentally calling it "that game," short for "that game I just cannot figure out how to make." After leaving Firebase for the much quicker Socket.IO, I was finally able to present this game even though it quickly crashed when my poor netcode had to handle a ton of players. All in all, this project taught me a ton about making a platformer (collisions, physics, combat, etc.) and set me out on a quest to find the ultimate solution for making multiplayer JavaScript games.</p>

First of all, I was not satisfied with Socket.IO, mainly because I relied on free servers (granted, most of my net code could have been greatly improved). While watching a devlog, I came across peer.js, and it seemed like the perfect thing for me, and it was! I ended up making a tic-tac-toe-inspired game that laid a lot of the foundation for Crown.JS.</p>

With this in mind, I decided to give myself a break from the NES emulator and do a CPU Jam where I make a CPU in three days and a PPU in three more. It was mostly a success, with me spending a day or two to perfect some of the bugs. This project taught me much more about CPU design than the first one, as I had to figure out how to actually design a full instruction set.</p>

It was a choice that I held a ton of value to, which makes sense considering the fact that I use my search engine for hours a day. But all this research got me thinking, "How does a search engine work?" I read up a bit on search algorithms, but I was really interested in HTML rendering. I found a tutorial written in Rust and used that as a jumping-off point for my Python version. This was a cool project that taught me a lot about parsing languages and showed me how the browser decides how to position things.</p>
