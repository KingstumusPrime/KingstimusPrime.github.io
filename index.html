                    <p>A custom POSIX compatible 32 bit operating and C Library written from complete scratch. Written primarily in C but leverages assembly to complete low level tasks and boot the operating system. Contains a monolithic kernel design and supports the FAT filesystem, ATA drives, basic I/O, user mode, virtual memory, VESA video modes, and Linux-style file handling. Along with this it has a relatively mature LibC and operating systems specific toolchain capable of porting basic programs such as the famous Doom I & II.</p>

                    <h3>NES Emulator <a href="https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/Nes-Emulator/"><img src="./assets/github-mark.svg"></a></h3>
                    <p>A working NES emulator written from complete scratch using C++ and SDL2 for the rendering and keyboard input. Includes a full 6502 emulator, a cycle accurate Picture Processing Unit (PPU), and a couple of debug tools such as a basic 6502 disassembler. Uses a proper object-oriented approach to emulate every single component as its own object making the codebase both easy to debug and conceptually correct.</p>

                    <p>Crown.JS is a Javascript library that attempts to streamline the creation of canvas based games in Javascript. It leverages Inherence and a classical object-oriented structure to allow the user to expand upon the engine and add features needed only for that project. Features include sprites, actors, a custom input system, a smooth movement library, and dynamic camera that supports shake. In addition the project also contains a bonus multiplayer header that serves as a wrapper for <a href="https://peerjs.com/">PEER.JS</a>. Allowing for multiplayer functionality in minutes.</p>

                <h2>Kingston James</h3>
                <p>My name is Kingston James and I have been programming as a hobby for around 5 years. I first started by learning Scratch then quickly moved onto Unreal Engine (blueprints) then C++. Ever since then I have followed a project based learning approach and am constantly trying to build new things. I'm an active student at St Petersburg Collage with a 4.0 GPA and I love participating in different activities held on campus. You will currently find me looking for a way to hone my skills by working with real-world professionals through internships.</p>

                    <h3>Experimentation with compiler design (G--) <a href="https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/g--/"><img src="./assets/github-mark.svg"></a></h3>
                    <p>This project is super important to me, as it was the first moment where I caught this kind of fever for writing low-level code. I was past wanting to know how things work; I wanted to make it work all by myself. This kind of feeling probably came from the desire for independence and self-reliance felt by most boys around my age. Personal philosophy aside, this project is a hodgepodge of languages, including Python, C++, JavaScript, and Java. It contains a parser (JavaScript), a lexer (Python), and two VMs (C++ and Java). While I had some vision of tying it all together, I never got a whole language together.</p>

                        <p>This project was the first time I understood what a neural network actually was and how it worked. While it was mainly following tutorials it taught me a lot about how to learn and approach things. In addition it taught me almost every JavaScript tip and design practice I know today.</p>

                        <p>This has to be my most successful project and debuted my career in multiplayer games. It taught me  how to deploy a game that a ton of people would play. It worked by using a firebase database as the server sacrificing speed for a valuable new skill. It also made me appreciate optimization as I had to squeeze every bit of performance to get things like AI to run. </p>
